    ingredients: [

      '1 medium/large sweet Vidalia or yellow onion, diced small',
      '1 pound boneless skinless chicken breast, diced into bite-sized pieces',
      '3 cloves garlic, finely minced or pressed',
      '2 to 3 teaspoons ground ginger or 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, finely chopped',
      '2 teaspoons ground coriander',
      'one 13-ounce can coconut milk (I used lite; full-fat will deliver a richer/thicker result)',
      '1 to 1 1/2 cups shredded carrots',
      '1 to 3 tablespoons Thai red curry paste, or to taste (curry powder may be substituted, to taste)',
      '1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste',
      '1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste',
      'about 3 cups fresh spinach leaves',
      '1 tablespoon lime juice',
      '1 to 2 tablespoons brown sugar, optional and to taste',
      '1/4 cup fresh cilantro, finely chopped for garnishing (basil may be substituted)',
      'rice, quinoa, or naan, optional for serving'
    ],
    instructions: [
      'To a large skillet, add the oil, onion, and sauté over medium-high heat until the onion begins to soften about 5 minutes; stir intermittently.',
      'Add the chicken and cook for about 5 minutes, or until chicken is done; flip and stir often to ensure even cooking.',
      'Add the garlic, ginger, coriander, and cook for about 1 minute, or until fragrant; stir frequently.',
      'Add the coconut milk, carrots, Thai curry paste, salt, pepper, and stir to combine. Reduce the heat to medium, and allow mixture to gently boil for about 5 minutes, or until liquid volume has reduced as much as desired and thickens slightly.',
      'Add the spinach, lime juice, and stir to combine. Cook until spinach has wilted and is tender, about 1 to 2 minutes. Taste and optionally add brown sugar, additional curry paste, salt, pepper, etc. to taste.',
      'Evenly sprinkle with the cilantro and serve immediately. Curry is best warm and fresh but will keep airtight in the fridge for up to 1 week.'
