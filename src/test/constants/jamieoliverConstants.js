    "name": "Crispy garlicky chicken",
    "description": "Super-simple to put together, this is a great, fast method for really good, crispy crumbed chicken, and Iâ€™ve added garlic for extra flavour. Pounding the chicken, both before adding the crumbs and to help them to stick, tenderises the meat and makes it even quicker to cook.",
    "ingredients": ["2 x 120 g skinless chicken breasts", "2 thick slices of seeded wholemeal bread (75g each)", "1 clove of garlic", "1  lemon", "50 g rocket"],
    "instructions": ["Place the chicken breasts between two large sheets of greaseproof paper, and whack with the base of a large non-stick frying pan to flatten them to about 1cm thick. Tear the bread into a food processor, then peel, chop and add the garlic, and blitz into fairly fine crumbs. Pour the crumbs over the chicken, roughly pat on to each side, then re-cover with the paper and whack again, to hammer the crumbs into the chicken and flatten them further.Put the pan on a medium heat. Fry the crumbed chicken in 1 tablespoon of olive oil for 3 minutes on each side, or until crisp, golden and cooked through. Slice, plate up, season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper, sprinkle with lemon-dressed rocket, and serve with lemon wedges, for squeezing over."],
