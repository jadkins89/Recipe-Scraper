      "Marinated London Broil with Potatoes, Broccoli, and Roasted Garlic Aioli",
    description:
      "This sheet pan dinner couldn&rsquo;t be easier (or more delicious), and utilizing inexpensive London broil, it&rsquo;s one you&rsquo;ll come back to again and again. Serving this budget-friendly dinner with a shortcut aioli takes the entire meal up a notch with minimal effort. In testing, we even found that using jarred roasted garlic, rather than preparing your own, absolutely delivers on flavor. London broil will be labeled as such in many supermarkets, but you can also substitute flank steak or top round.",
    ingredients: [
      "½ cup olive oil",
      "3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce",
      "2 tablespoons tamari or soy sauce",
      "1 tablespoon lemon zest (from 1 large lemon)",
      "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme",
      "2 teaspoons Sriracha chile sauce",
      "1 ½ teaspoons grated garlic (about 3 garlic cloves)",
      "1 (1 1/2 lb.) London broil steak",
      "1 ½ pounds multicolored baby new potatoes",
      "3 tablespoons olive oil, divided",
      "1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt, divided",
      "1 teaspoon black pepper, divided",
      "12 ounces broccoli florets",
      "½ cup mayonnaise",
      "2 teaspoons prepared roasted garlic",
      "1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice (from 1 lemon)",
      "¼ teaspoon kosher salt",
      "¼ teaspoon black pepper",
      "¼ teaspoon granulated sugar"
    ],
    instructions: [
      "Stir together oil, Worcestershire, tamari, lemon zest, thyme, Sriracha, and garlic in a medium bowl. Place steak in a 13- x 9-inch baking dish or a gallon-sized plastic ziplock bag; pour marinade over steak to fully coat. Cover, and let marinate at least 2 hours or up to overnight in refrigerator, turning occasionally. ",
      "Preheat broiler to HIGH with an oven rack 6 to 8 inches from heat. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Toss together potatoes, 1 tablespoon of the oil, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of the pepper. Spread in an even layer on prepared baking sheet. Broil until starting to blister, about 5 minutes.",
      "Remove steak from marinade. Pat dry; discard marinade. Place steak in center of prepared baking sheet, and arrange blistered potatoes around steak. Sprinkle steak with 1/4 teaspoon each of the salt and pepper. Broil 3 minutes.",
      "Toss together broccoli, and remaining 2 tablespoons oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Arrange broccoli around steak, and broil until potatoes are fork tender, broccoli is charred and tender, and a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of steak registers 125°F, 5 to 8 minutes. Let steak rest 10 minutes before thinly slicing against the grain. ",
      "While steak rests, prepare the aioli: Stir together mayonnaise, roasted garlic, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and sugar in a small bowl. Serve sliced London broil and vegetables with aioli. "
