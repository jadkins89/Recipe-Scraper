    name: "Doughnut muffins",
    description: "These individual sugar-dipped cupcakes are baked not fried but taste just as delicious, from BBC Good Food.",
    ingredients: [
      "140g golden caster sugar, plus 200g extra for dusting",
      "200g plain flour",
      "1 tsp bicarbonate of soda",
      "100ml natural yogurt",
      "2 large eggs, beaten",
      "1 tsp vanilla extract",
      "140g butter, melted, plus extra for greasing",
      "12 tsp seedless raspberry jam"
    ],
    instructions: [
      "Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Lightly grease a 12-hole muffin tin (or use a silicone one). Put 140g sugar, flour and bicarb in a bowl and mix to combine. In a jug, whisk together the yogurt, eggs and vanilla. Tip the jug contents and melted butter into the dry ingredients and quickly fold with a metal spoon to combine.",
      "Divide two-thirds of the mixture between the muffin holes. Carefully add 1 tsp jam into the centre of each, then cover with the remaining mixture. Bake for 16-18 mins until risen, golden and springy to touch.",
      "Leave the muffins to cool for 5 mins before lifting out of the tin and rolling in the extra sugar."
