    name: 'Soba Noodles With Crispy Kale',
    description: 'Heidi Swanson, the vegetarian cookbook author and blogger behind 101 Cookbooks, has the power to make a bowl of tofu and lentils look as appealing as guanciale-flecked carbonara. In this noodle bowl, nutritional yeast acts like a vegan version of parm, adding a hit of umami flavor that plays well with bitter kale and earthy buckwheat noodles. We suggest using curly kale, which roasts into light, crispy chips, instead of Tuscan.',
    ingredients: [
      '1 medium bunch curly kale, ribs and stems removed, leaves coarsely chopped (about 4 cups)',
      '1¼ cups unsweetened coconut flakes',
      '⅓ cup nutritional yeast',
      '½ tsp. kosher salt, plus more',
      '2 Tbsp. plus ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil',
      '8 oz. dried soba noodles',
      '3 Tbsp. tahini',
      '2 Tbsp. plus 2 tsp. soy sauce',
      '1 Tbsp. honey',
      '2 tsp. toasted sesame oil, plus more for drizzling',
      '½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes, plus more for serving',
      '1 lime'
    ],
    instructions: [
      'Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat to 375°. Toss kale, coconut, nutritional yeast, ½ tsp. salt, and 2 Tbsp. olive oil in a large bowl to coat. Divide mixture evenly between 2 rimmed baking sheets and roast, tossing and rotating baking sheets halfway through, until kale is crisp and coconut is golden brown, 15–20 minutes.',
      'While kale is roasting, cook noodles in a large pot of boiling water according to package directions. Drain and rinse under cold running water. Shake off any residual water and place noodles in a clean large bowl.',
      'Combine tahini, soy sauce, honey, 2 tsp. sesame oil, ½ tsp. red pepper flakes, and remaining ½ cup olive oil in a small bowl. Finely grate zest from lime directly into bowl; halve lime and squeeze in juice (about 2 Tbsp.). Whisk dressing until smooth, then pour about half of it over noodles; toss to coat.',
      'Add half of kale mixture to noodles and toss to incorporate. Drizzle in more dressing as needed, tossing until noodles are creamy; season with salt. Pile remaining kale on top. Drizzle with additional sesame oil and sprinkle with more red pepper flakes.'
