    name: "Soba Noodles With Crispy Kale",
    description: "Heidi Swanson, the vegetarian cookbook author and blogger behind 101 Cookbooks, has the power to make a bowl of tofu and lentils look as appealing as guanciale-flecked carbonara. In this noodle bowl, nutritional yeast acts like a vegan version of parm, adding a hit of umami flavor that plays well with bitter kale and earthy buckwheat noodles. We suggest using curly kale, which roasts into light, crispy chips, instead of Tuscan.",
    ingredients: [
      "1 medium bunch curly kale, ribs and stems removed, leaves coarsely chopped (about 4 cups)",
      "1¼ cups unsweetened coconut flakes",
      "⅓ cup nutritional yeast",
      "½ tsp. kosher salt, plus more",
      "2 Tbsp. plus ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil",
      "8 oz. dried soba noodles",
      "3 Tbsp. tahini",
      "2 Tbsp. plus 2 tsp. soy sauce",
      "1 Tbsp. honey",
      "2 tsp. toasted sesame oil, plus more for drizzling",
      "½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes, plus more for serving",
      "1 lime"
    ],
    instructions: [
      "Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat to 375°. Toss kale, coconut, nutritional yeast, ½ tsp. salt, and 2 Tbsp. olive oil in a large bowl to coat. Divide mixture evenly between 2 rimmed baking sheets and roast, tossing and rotating baking sheets halfway through, until kale is crisp and coconut is golden brown, 15–20 minutes.",
      "While kale is roasting, cook noodles in a large pot of boiling water according to package directions. Drain and rinse under cold running water. Shake off any residual water and place noodles in a clean large bowl.",
      "Combine tahini, soy sauce, honey, 2 tsp. sesame oil, ½ tsp. red pepper flakes, and remaining ½ cup olive oil in a small bowl. Finely grate zest from lime directly into bowl; halve lime and squeeze in juice (about 2 Tbsp.). Whisk dressing until smooth, then pour about half of it over noodles; toss to coat.",
      "Add half of kale mixture to noodles and toss to incorporate. Drizzle in more dressing as needed, tossing until noodles are creamy; season with salt. Pile remaining kale on top. Drizzle with additional sesame oil and sprinkle with more red pepper flakes."
