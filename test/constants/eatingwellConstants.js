    name: "Pressure-Cooker Chicken Enchilada Soup",
    description:
      "This easy soup flavored with chili powder and a splash of lime is quick enough to prepare for a warming weeknight meal thanks to an electric pressure cooker like the Instant Pot. Lean chicken breast is easy to prep, but boneless, skinless chicken thighs would make a great substitute.",
    ingredients: [
      "1 tablespoon olive oil",
      "1 medium onion, chopped",
      "1 poblano pepper, seeded and chopped",

      "3 cloves garlic, minced",
      "2 tablespoons chili powder",
      "1 teaspoon salt",
      "4 cups low-sodium chicken broth",
      "1 (15 ounce) can low-sodium black beans, rinsed",
      "1 (14 ounce) can no-salt-added fire-roasted diced tomatoes",
      "Juice of 1 lime",
      "½ cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus more for garnish",
      "¾ cup shredded Mexican-style cheese blend",
      "Tortilla chips for garnish"
    ],
    instructions: [
      "Heat oil on high heat using the sauté function of your multicooker. (No sauté mode? See Tip.) Add onion, poblano, chicken, garlic, chili powder and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables have softened and the chicken is no longer pink on the outside, about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat. Stir in broth, beans and tomatoes. Close and lock the lid. Cook at high pressure for 10 minutes.",
      "Release the pressure carefully. Stir in lime juice and cilantro. Top each serving with 2 tablespoons cheese and more cilantro, if desired. Garnish with tortilla chips, if desired."
