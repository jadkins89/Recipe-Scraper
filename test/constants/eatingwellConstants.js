    name: 'Pressure-Cooker Chicken Enchilada Soup',
    description: 'This easy soup flavored with chili powder and a splash of lime is quick enough to prepare for a warming weeknight meal thanks to an electric pressure cooker like the Instant Pot. Lean chicken breast is easy to prep, but boneless, skinless chicken thighs would make a great substitute.',
    ingredients: [
      '1 tablespoon olive oil',
      '1 medium onion, chopped',
      '1 poblano pepper, seeded and chopped',
      '1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into 1/2-inch pieces',
      '3 cloves garlic, minced',
      '2 tablespoons chili powder',
      '1 teaspoon salt',
      '4 cups low-sodium chicken broth',
      '1 (15 ounce) can low-sodium black beans, rinsed',
      '1 (14 ounce) can no-salt-added fire-roasted diced tomatoes',
      'Juice of 1 lime',
      '0.5 cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus more for garnish',
      '0.75 cup shredded Mexican-style cheese blend',
      'Tortilla chips for garnish'
