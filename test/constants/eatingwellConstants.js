    "instructions": ["Heat oil on high heat using the sauté function of your multicooker. (No sauté mode? See Tip.) Add onion, poblano, chicken, garlic, chili powder and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables have softened and the chicken is no longer pink on the outside, about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat. Stir in broth, beans and tomatoes. Close and lock the lid. Cook at high pressure for 10 minutes.", "Release the pressure carefully. Stir in lime juice and cilantro. Top each serving with 2 tablespoons cheese and more cilantro, if desired. Garnish with tortilla chips, if desired."],
