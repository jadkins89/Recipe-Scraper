    name: 'Cast-Iron Skillet Provencal Pork Chops and Potatoes',
    description: 'Everything in this elegant-yet-easy dish cooks in one skillet, cutting down on the cleanup. Holding the potatoes in water after cutting prevents them from discoloring while you prep the other ingredients.',
    ingredients: [
      '2 medium Yukon gold potatoes (about 3/4 pound), cut into 1/2-inch chunks and soaked in cold water until ready to use',
      '3 tablespoons olive oil',
      'Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper',
      'Four boneless pork loin chops, 3/4-inch thick, excess fat trimmed',
      '1/4 cup pitted Kalamata olives, roughly chopped',
      '4 teaspoons drained capers',
      '3 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed',
      '3 sprigs of thyme',
      '1 cup halved cherry tomatoes (about 1 pint)',
      '1/2 cup white wine',
      '1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth',
      '1/4 cup packed fresh parsley leaves, roughly chopped'
    ],
    instructions: [
      'Drain the potatoes. Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over high heat until very hot, about 2 minutes. Add the potatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until they start to become tender and are just beginning to brown around the edges, about 5 minutes.',
      'Sprinkle the pork chops with salt and pepper. Move the potatoes to the far edge of the pan, leaving a space to brown the pork chops. Add the pork chops to the pan and cook until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. As the pork chops cook, give the potatoes an occasional stir so they continue to brown evenly. Place the pork chops on top of the potatoes, shingling them to leave as much room in the pan as possible. Reduce the heat to low and add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the bare area of the pan. Add the olives, capers, garlic and thyme and cook, stirring continuously, until fragrant and golden, 1 to 2 minutes.',
      'Increase the heat to medium, add the tomatoes and wine and cook until reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes, then stir in the chicken broth. Put the pork chops in the sauce and carefully nestle the potatoes around them. Cook 3 to 5 minutes more until the pork chops register 145 degrees F in the center on an instant-read thermometer. Remove the pork chops from the sauce and transfer to shallow bowls or a serving platter. Taste the sauce and season with additional salt and pepper if needed. If most of the liquid in the pan evaporates while you are cooking the pork, stir in tablespoons of water at a time to get it back to a saucy consistency. If the sauce is a little thin and weak, after you take the chops out, turn the heat up and cook 1 to 2 minutes more to thicken and concentrate the flavors. Stir the parsley into the sauce, remove the thyme sprigs, spoon the sauce over the chops and serve.'

    description: 'Get Knead Not Sourdough Recipe from Food Network',
    ingredients: [
      '17 1/2 ounces bread flour, plus extra for shaping',
      '1/4 teaspoon active-dry yeast',
      '2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt',
      '12 ounces filtered water',
      '2 tablespoons cornmeal'
    ],
    instructions: [
      'Whisk together the flour, yeast and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add the water and stir until combined. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow to sit at room temperature for 19 hours.',
      'After 19 hours, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Punch down the dough and turn it over onto itself a couple of times. Cover with a tea towel and allow to rest 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, shape the dough into a ball. Coat hands with flour, if needed, to prevent sticking. Sprinkle the tea towel with half of the cornmeal and lay the dough on top of it, with the seam side down. Sprinkle the top of the dough with the other half of the cornmeal and cover with the towel. Allow to rise for another 2 to 3 hours, or until the dough has doubled in size.',
      'Oven baking: While the dough is rising the second time, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Place a 4 to 5-quart Dutch oven in the oven while it preheats. Once the dough is ready, carefully transfer it to the pre-heated Dutch oven. Cover and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the lid and bake until the bread reaches an internal temperature of 210 to 212 degrees F, another 15 minutes. Transfer the bread to a cooling rack and allow to cool at least 15 minutes before serving.',
      'Outdoor coals: Heat charcoal in a chimney starter until ash covers all of the coals. Place 20 to 24 coals on a Dutch oven table. Place a cooling rack (or other wire rack that is at least 2-inches high) directly over the coals. Set a 5-quart Dutch oven on top of this rack and allow to preheat during the last 30 minutes of the second rise. Carefully transfer the dough to the Dutch oven and cover with the lid. Place 20 coals on top. Bake until the bread reaches an internal temperature of 210 to 212 degrees F, about 45 minutes. Transfer the bread to a cooling rack and allow to cool at least 15 minutes before serving.'
