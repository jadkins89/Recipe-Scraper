    name: "The Juiciest Grilled Chicken Kabobs",
    ingredients: [
      "4 boneless skinless chicken breasts, pounded to even thickness and brined in saltwater (*see easy instructions below)",
      "1 Tablespoon melted butter or olive oil",
      "1 teaspoon kosher salt",
      "1/2 teaspoon freshly-cracked black pepper",
      "1/2 teaspoon garlic powder",
      "1/2 teaspoon paprika (I prefer smoked paprika)",
      "optional: fresh lemon wedges"
    ],
    instructions: [
      "To brine the chicken breasts, fill a large bowl with 1 quart of warm water and 1/4 cup kosher salt.  Stir to combine until most of the salt is absorbed.  Add the whole chicken breasts and let them sit in the mixture to brine for 15 minutes.  Or you can also also cover the bowl and refrigerate for up to 6 hours.  Remove the chicken breasts from the brine, rinse them with cold water, then pat them dry with some paper towels.  (If the chicken breasts you purchased have already been pre-brined in a sodium solution, skip this brining step completely.)",
      "Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.  If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 15 minutes before using.",
      "Cut the chicken breasts into 1-inch pieces.  Add them to a large mixing bowl and drizzle evenly with the olive oil.  Toss to combine.",
      "In a separate small bowl, whisk together the salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika until combined.  Sprinkle the seasoning mixture evenly over the chicken.  Then toss for 1 minute, or until the chicken is evenly coated with the seasoning.  Thread the chicken evenly onto the skewers.",
      "Once the grill is hot, place the chicken kabobs evenly on the grill.  Cook for 10-14 minutes, turning once halfway through, until the chicken is golden brown and cooked through (no longer pink on the inside).",
      "Transfer the kabobs to a clean plate, and loosely tent with aluminum foil.  Let the chicken rest for at least 5-10 minutes.",
      "Then serve warm while the chicken is hot and juicy, drizzled with freshly-squeezed lemon juice if desired.  Or, refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 3 months."
