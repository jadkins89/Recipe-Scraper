    name: "Crispy garlicky chicken",
    description: "This beautiful easy chicken breast recipe from Jamie Oliver is so simple and so delicious. Great just with the lemony rocket, or add some roasted veggies.",
    ingredients: [
        "2 x 120 g free-range skinless chicken breasts",
        "2 thick slices of seeded wholemeal bread , (75g each)",
        "1 clove of garlic",
        "1 lemon",
        "50 g rocket"
    ],
    instructions: [
      "Place the chicken breasts between two large sheets of greaseproof paper, and whack with the base of a large non-stick frying pan to flatten them to about 1cm thick.",
      "Tear the bread into a food processor, then peel, chop and add the garlic, and blitz into fairly fine crumbs.",
      "Pour the crumbs over the chicken, roughly pat on to each side, then re-cover with the paper and whack again, to hammer the crumbs into the chicken and flatten them further.",
      "Put the pan on a medium heat. Fry the crumbed chicken in 1 tablespoon of olive oil for 3 minutes on each side, or until crisp, golden and cooked through.",
      "Slice, plate up, season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper, sprinkle with lemon-dressed rocket, and serve with lemon wedges, for squeezing over."
