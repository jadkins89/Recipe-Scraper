    name: "Endives with Oranges and Almonds",
    description: "",
    ingredients: [
      "3 oranges (I used 2 navel and one cara cara orange)",
      "2 heads of endive",
      "2 ounces soft goat cheese or chevre, crumbled",
      "1/3 cup sliced almonds or chopped marcona almonds, well-toasted",
      "Freshly ground black pepper",
      "Olive oil for drizzling",
      "Sherry vinegar",
      "1 tablespoon minced chives",
      "Flaky or other sea salt, to finish"
    ],
    instructions: [
      "Cut the top and bottom off your oranges, exposing the citrus flesh inside. Then, resting on either end, cut the peels, including the white pith, off the oranges. [Set aside for orangettes!] Use your knife to cut between each membrane and orange segment, cutting only so far as the center, which should release the orange segments. You can chop them once or twice more, so the pieces are not too large.",
      "Trim end off endives and arrange individual leaves on a medium platter. Add a few orange chunks to each, then goat cheese crumbles and almonds. Season with black pepper, then drizzle with a very thin stream of olive oil. Add a few droplets of sherry vinegar to each “boat.” Scatter chives over and finish each with sea salt.",
      "Dig in. No forks needed, unless you’re classy."

    ingredients: [
      "Crust",
      "1 1/4 cups (155 grams) all-purpose flour",
      "1 1/2 teaspoons (6 grams) granulated sugar",
      "1/2 teaspoon (3 grams) fine sea or table salt",
      "1/2 cup (4 ounces or 115 grams) cold unsalted butter, cut into chunks",
      "1/4 cup (60 ml) very cold water",
      "Filling",
      "4 cups (about 2 pints or 680 grams) blueberries",
      "2 cups (about 1 12-ounce/340-grams package) blackberries",
      "3/4 cup (150 grams) granulated sugar (for a moderately, but not very, sweet pie)",
      "Juice of half a lemon",
      "7 tablespoons (55 grams) tapioca flour (starch) or 5 1/2 tablespoons (45 grams) cornstarch (see Note)",
      "Pinch of salt",

      "6 tablespoons (75 grams) granulated sugar",

      "1 teaspoon baking powder",
      "1 1/3 cups (175 grams) all-purpose flour",
      "Two pinches of salt"
    ],
    instructions: [
      "Make pie dough:",
      "– By hand : In the bottom of a large bowl, combine the flour, salt and sugar. Work the butter into the flour with your fingertips or a pastry blender until mixture resembles a coarse meal and the largest bits of butter are the size of tiny peas. (Some people like to do this by freezing the stick of butter and coarsely grating it into the flour, but I haven’t found the results as flaky.) Add 1/4 cup cold water and stir with a spoon or flexible silicone spatula until large clumps form. Use your hands to knead the dough together, right in the bottom of the bowl. If necessary to bring the dough together, you can add another tablespoon of water.",
      "– With a food processor: In the work bowl of a food processor, combine flour, salt and sugar. Add butter and pulse machine until mixture resembles a coarse meal and the largest bits of butter are the size of tiny peas. Turn mixture out into mixing bowl. Add 1/4 cup cold water and stir with a spoon or flexible silicone spatula until large clumps form. Use your hands to knead the dough together, right in the bottom of the bowl. If necessary to bring the dough together, you can add the last tablespoon of water.",
      "– Both methods: Wrap dough in a sheet of plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least one hour, or up to 48 hours, or you can quick-firm this in the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes. Longer than 2 days, it’s best to freeze it until needed.",
      "Heat oven: To 400°F (205°C). ",
      "Roll out crust: On a floured counter, roll the dough out into a 12 to 13-inch circle-ish shape. Fold dough gently in quarters without creasing and transfer to a 9 1/2-inch standard (not deep-dish) pie plate. Unfold dough and trim overhang to about 1/2-inch. Fold overhang under edge of pie crust and crimp decoratively. Save scraps in fridge, just in case.",
      "Par-bake crust: Freeze for 15 minutes, until solid. Dock all over with a fork. Coat a piece of foil with butter or nonstick spray and press tightly against frozen pie shell, covering the dough and rim and molding it to fit the shape of the edges. Bake for 20 minutes, then carefully, gently remove foil. (Set the foil, still molded, aside. It will come in handy later.) If any parts have puffed, just press them gently back into place. Patch any tears or cracks with reserved dough scraps. Reduce oven temperature to 375°F and leave oven on.",
      "Meanwhile, make filling: Mix all filling ingredients in a large bowl and set aside. ",
      "To make crumb topping, stir sugar, zest, baking powder, flour and salt into melted butter in a large bowl with a fork until crumbs form. ",
      "Assemble and bake: Pour filling into crust and scatter crumbs over the top. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes with these two important things in mind: ",
      "1. This crumb browns much more quickly than the pie is done. Grab that piece of foil you set aside from the parbaking phase and upend it over the top of the pie to protect it against further browning once it reaches the color you want. This might only take 20 to 30 minutes. ",
      "2. Fruit pies are done when you can see bubbles forming at the edges, with some creeping through and over some crumbs. If it takes longer, that’s better than an underbaked pie.",
      "To serve: Try to let the pie cool until close to room temperature before serving. This gives the pie thickener a chance to help the pie set. The pie will be even better set after a night in the fridge. Bring it back to room temperature before serving."

Beat in vanilla. Pour over prepared crust (still hot is fine) and bake for 25 minutes, until puffed but still jiggly like Jell-O when shimmied. Let cool on rack for 5 minutes, and while it does…",
      "Make topping: Whisk together sour cream, sugar, and vanilla. Drop spoonfuls of topping all over bars and spread gently in one thin layer. Bake bars with topping for 10 minutes. ",
      "Set pan on a cooling rack and let cool; refrigerate at least 2 hours or ideally overnight. ",
      "To serve: Use foil sling to carefully lift bars out of pan and transfer them to a cutting board. If you can, carefully slide them off their foil — this should be doable, but I did manage to crack my whole slab of bars while doing so, so proceed at your own risk. Scatter berries all over cake. Cut gently into 2×2-ish-inch squares with a serrated knife. Keep leftovers in fridge. Repeat again next weekend."
