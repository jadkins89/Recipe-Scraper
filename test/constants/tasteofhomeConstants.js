    name: "Artichoke Chicken",
    description: "Rosemary, mushrooms and artichokes combine to give this chicken a wonderful, savory flavor. I've served this healthy canned vegetable recipe for a large group by doubling the batch. It's always a big hit with everyone—especially my family! —Ruth Stenson, Santa Ana, California",
    ingredients: [
      "8 boneless skinless chicken breast halves (4 ounces each)",
      "2 tablespoons butter",
      "2 jars (6 ounces each) marinated quartered artichoke hearts, drained",
      "1 jar (4-1/2 ounces) whole mushrooms, drained",
      "1/2 cup chopped onion",
      "1/3 cup all-purpose flour",
      "1-1/2 teaspoons dried rosemary, crushed",
      "3/4 teaspoon salt",
      "1/4 teaspoon pepper",
      "2 cups chicken broth or 1 cup broth and 1 cup dry white wine",
      "Hot cooked noodles",
      "Minced fresh parsley"
    ],
    instructions: [
      "In a large skillet, brown chicken in butter. Remove chicken to an ungreased 13x9-in. baking dish. Arrange artichokes and mushrooms on top of chicken; set aside.",
      "Saute onion in pan juices until crisp-tender. Combine the flour, rosemary, salt and pepper. Stir into pan until blended. Add chicken broth. Bring to a boil; cook and stir until thickened and bubbly, about 2 minutes. Spoon over chicken.",
      "Bake, uncovered, at 350° until a thermometer inserted in the chicken reads 165°, about 40 minutes. Serve with noodles and sprinkle with parsley. Freeze option: Cool unbaked casserole; cover and freeze. To use, partially thaw in refrigerator overnight. Remove from refrigerator 30 minutes before baking. Preheat oven to 350°. Bake casserole as directed, increasing time as necessary to heat through and for a thermometer inserted in the chicken to read 165°."
