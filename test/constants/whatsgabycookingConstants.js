      "1 teaspoon dried oregano",
      "1 teaspoon cumin",
      "½ teaspoon paprika",
      "3-4 chipotles in adobo",
      "1 pound dry black beans",
      "1 teaspoon kosher salt",
      "6 cups water",
      "3 large sweet potatoes diced",
      "2 tablespoons olive oil",
      "kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper",

    instructions: [
      "For the Black Beans",
      'Turn the instant pot to saute. Add the oil, red onion and garlic and saute for 3-4 minutes. Add the spices and peppers and stir to combine. Add the dry beans, salt, and water in the bowl of the Instant Pot and give it a stir.  Cover with the lid, and be sure to turn the vent at the top to the "sealed" position. Set the Instant Pot to cook for 45 minutes on the Chili setting. When the timer goes off, let the steam pressure naturally release for at least 20 minutes before attempting to remove the lid. Drain the beans from most of their liquid and store them in an airtight container the fridge or freezer until ready to use.',
      "For the sweet potatoes",
      "While the beans are cooking, dice the sweet potatoes and transfer to a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil, salt and pepper and roast in a 425 degree oven for 25-30 minutes until golden brown. Remove and set aside.",
      "For the Cauliflower rice",
      "Make sure your cauliflower is fully dry. Place the cauliflower in a food processor and pulse until it has the texture of rice. Work in batches and don’t over process or it will get mushy. In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Add the kale and sauté until wilted. Add the cauliflower and saute, until heated through, about 5 minutes. Season with salt, pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice to help remove any bitterness from the raw cauliflower.",
      "Assembly",
      "Portion the Cauliflower rice into 4 serving bowls. Add a spoonful of the beans to each bowl and a spoonful of the roasted sweet potatoes. Top with plenty of guacamole and serve."
